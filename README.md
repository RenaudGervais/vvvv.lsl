# LSL for VVVV

[Lab Streaming Layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) (LSL) is "a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, (near-) real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data".

This is a very simple adaptation of the C# examples for receiving values in VVVV.
